Thank you for your time for reviewing my Starbucks Capstone project.

* All my project code is supposed to be in the Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb file. The datasets used by 
my project are all in the data folder with three files in it. They are listed below:

	* portfolio.json
	* profile.json
	* transcript.json

The csv file named model_df.csv contains the dataframe data produced after calculating each user's valid offer completion, which 
requires quite some computation. Thus, it is saved separately as a csv file.
